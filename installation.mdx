description: Install Markdown-OS using pip or uv package manager. Supports Python 3.11+.
---

# Installation

Markdown-OS is distributed as a Python package on PyPI. You can install it using `pip` or the modern `uv` package manager.

## Requirements

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Python Version" icon="python">
    Python 3.11 or higher (3.11, 3.12, 3.13 tested)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Operating System" icon="desktop">
    Linux, macOS, or Windows (with POSIX compatibility notes)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  File locking uses POSIX `fcntl` and is optimized for Linux/macOS. Windows users may need WSL for full compatibility.
</Note>

## Install with pip

The standard Python package installer:

```bash
pip install markdown-os
```

This installs the `markdown-os` CLI command globally in your Python environment.

<Warning>
  Installing with pip in your global Python environment may cause dependency conflicts. Consider using a virtual environment or `pipx` for isolated installation.
</Warning>

### Using pipx (Recommended)

For isolated CLI tool installation:

```bash
pipx install markdown-os
```

This creates an isolated environment and adds the command to your PATH without affecting other Python packages.

## Install with uv (Recommended)

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast, modern Python package manager. It's the recommended installation method for Markdown-OS.

### Install uv

If you don't have uv installed:

<CodeGroup>
```bash macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Install Markdown-OS

Use uv's tool installer for clean, isolated installation:

```bash
uv tool install markdown-os
```

This creates an isolated environment and makes the `markdown-os` command available globally.

<Note>
  The `uv tool install` command is similar to `pipx install` but uses uv's faster resolver and installer.
</Note>

## Verify Installation

Check that Markdown-OS is installed correctly:

```bash
markdown-os --help
```

You should see output like:

```text
Usage: markdown-os [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Open and edit markdown files in a local browser UI.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  example  Generate a showcase markdown file that demonstrates...
  open     Start a local web editor for a markdown file or...
```

## Upgrading

### Upgrade with pip

```bash
pip install --upgrade markdown-os
```

### Upgrade with uv

```bash
uv tool upgrade markdown-os
```

<Note>
  Check the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/elena-cabrera/markdown-os/releases) or [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-os/) for the latest version.
</Note>

## Uninstalling

### Uninstall with pip

```bash
pip uninstall markdown-os
```

### Uninstall with uv

```bash
uv tool uninstall markdown-os
```

## Dependencies

Markdown-OS automatically installs the following Python dependencies:

| Package | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fastapi` | ≥0.129.0 | Web framework for the server |
| `python-multipart` | ≥0.0.22 | Multipart form parsing for image uploads |
| `typer` | ≥0.23.1 | CLI framework |
| `uvicorn[standard]` | ≥0.40.0 | ASGI server |
| `portalocker` | ≥3.0.0 | Cross-platform file locking |
| `watchdog` | ≥6.0.0 | File system monitoring |
| `websockets` | ≥16.0 | WebSocket support for live sync |

These are handled automatically during installation.

## Development Installation

If you want to contribute to Markdown-OS or run the development version:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/elena-cabrera/markdown-os.git
    cd markdown-os
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install uv (if needed)">
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    
    This reads `pyproject.toml` and installs all dependencies including dev tools.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run from source">
    ```bash
    uv run markdown-os open ./example.md
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Running Tests

The project includes 61 async-compatible tests using pytest:

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest -v

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py

# Run single test
uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py::test_validate_markdown_file_returns_resolved_path
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

If `markdown-os` is not found after installation:

1. **Check your PATH**: Ensure pip/uv's bin directory is in your PATH
2. **Reinstall**: Try uninstalling and reinstalling
3. **Use full path**: Try `python -m markdown_os.cli` instead

### Python Version Errors

Markdown-OS requires Python 3.11+. Check your version:

```bash
python --version
```

If you have multiple Python versions:

```bash
python3.11 -m pip install markdown-os
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv python install 3.13
uv tool install markdown-os
```

### Import Errors

If you see import errors, ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install --force-reinstall markdown-os
```

### Port Already in Use

Markdown-OS defaults to port 8000 but auto-increments if occupied. Watch the CLI output for the actual URL:

```text
Opening file /path/to/notes.md at http://127.0.0.1:8001
```

You can also specify a custom port:

```bash
markdown-os open notes.md --port 9000
```

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS

<Note>
  macOS users should have no issues. The app opens your default browser automatically.
</Note>

### Linux

Linux users may see harmless dbus warnings when the browser auto-opens:

```text
No GSettings schemas are installed on the system
```

These can be ignored. The server still works perfectly.

### Windows

Windows users should use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for best compatibility due to file locking differences:

```bash
wsl --install
```

Then install and run Markdown-OS from within WSL.

## Cloud VMs and Remote Access

If running on a cloud VM or remote server, bind to `0.0.0.0` to allow external access:

```bash
markdown-os open notes.md --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

<Warning>
  Binding to `0.0.0.0` exposes your files to the network without authentication. Only use this on trusted networks or with proper firewall rules.
</Warning>
