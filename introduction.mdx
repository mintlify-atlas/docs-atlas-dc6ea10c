## Key Features

### Single File Mode

Open a single markdown file with a clean, distraction-free interface:

```bash
markdown-os open ./notes.md
```

Perfect for quick edits, personal notes, or focused writing sessions.

### Directory Workspace Mode

Work with entire documentation projects using the folder mode:

```bash
markdown-os open ./my-docs
```

Features include:
- File tree sidebar with search
- Multi-file tabs (up to 15)
- Smart tab naming for duplicate filenames
- URL-based file routing
- Cached content and scroll positions per tab

<Note>
  The app automatically detects whether you're opening a file or directory and switches modes accordingly.
</Note>

### WYSIWYG Editing

Edit markdown in a rich WYSIWYG editor powered by `contenteditable` with:

- **Inline shortcuts**: Type `**text**` and it becomes bold automatically
- **Click-to-edit blocks**: Code blocks, Mermaid diagrams, and math equations
- **Smart formatting**: Heading shortcuts with `#`, list auto-continuation
- **Image paste/drop**: Ctrl+V or drag images directly into the editor
- **Undo/redo history**: Full editing history with keyboard shortcuts

### Developer-Friendly Architecture

### File Safety

Robust file handling ensures your content is always safe:

- **POSIX file locks**: Shared locks for reads, exclusive locks for writes
- **Atomic writes**: Content written to temp file → fsync → atomic replace
- **Conflict detection**: Warns when external changes conflict with unsaved edits
- **WebSocket sync**: Real-time notifications for external file changes

<Warning>
  File locks use POSIX `fcntl` and are currently optimized for Linux/macOS. Windows compatibility may require adaptation.
</Warning>
